  When true, the endpoint also returns all the embedded aggregate transactions.
  Otherwise, only top-level transactions used to calculate the block transactionsHash are returned.
  **Note:** This field does not work when combined with the ``address`` parameter. This is,
  embedded transactions containing the address specified through the ``address`` parameter
  will not be returned even when used with ``embedded=true``. There is no problem when using
  other parameters like ``recipientAddress`` instead.
