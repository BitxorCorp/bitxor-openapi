summary: Announce a new transaction
description: |
  Announces a transaction to the network.
  The [catbuffer library](https://github.com/bitxorcorp/catbuffer) defines the protocol to serialize and deserialize Bitxor entities.
  Catbuffers are integrated into [Bitxor SDKs](https://bitxorcorp.github.io/sdk.html). 
  It's recommended to use SDKs instead of calling the API endpoint directly to announce transactions.
